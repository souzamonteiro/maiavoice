the mute muffled the high tones of the horn
the gold ring sits only have pierced ear
the old pan was covered with hard fudge
watch the log float in the white river
the node on the stock of wheat grew daily
the heap of fallen leaves was set on fire
right fast if you want to sinister early
his shirt was clean but one button was gone
the barrel of beer was abreu of malt and hops
tin cans are absent from store shelves
